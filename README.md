# OralHistory

The oral history booth will allow a user to record their own stories at their time at Harding University.
The user will be prompt with a welcome page then they will be prompt with an acknowledge page. Where they are required to read the requirements to the audio recordings.
They will then fill out a short form to help identify who they are and what decade they are wanting to talk.

button to go back to edit their form if needed.
